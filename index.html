            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Dr. Qun Wang is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at San Francisco State University (SFSU). His research focuses on Edge Artificial Intelligence (EAI), distributed learning, and optimization for wireless communication systems, with particular emphasis on IoT networks and resource-constrained environments. Dr. Wang's work aims to develop efficient data processing frameworks that address challenges in real-time data analysis, collaborative learning, and model deployment across heterogeneous edge devices. Before joining SFSU, Dr. Wang earned his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Utah State University with a focus on machine learning and network optimization, contributing to several key projects in mobile computing and intelligent application development. He also worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) for 5G NR-based scientific edge computing simulation. He has published extensively in collaborative edge computing and energy-efficient communication systems. Dr. Wang is also dedicated to advancing STEM education, mentoring both graduate and undergraduate students, and integrating his research into the curriculum. He is passionate about fostering inclusive research opportunities through partnerships with programs like PINK at SFSU, aiming to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in cutting-edge research.
